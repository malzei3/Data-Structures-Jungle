	/**
	 * Function: give_buzzer()
         * Return:   buzzer-ID (integer) assigned to the new customer.
	 * Description:  This is the "enqueue" operation.  For us
	 *    a "buzzer" is represented by an integer (starting
	 *    from zero).  The function selects an available buzzer 
	 *    and places a new entry at the end of the service queue 
	 *    with the selected buzer-ID. 
	 *    This buzzer ID is returned.
	 *    The assigned buzzer-ID is a non-negative integer 
	 *    with the following properties:
	 *
	 *       (1) the buzzer (really it's ID) is not currently 
	 *         taken -- i.e., not in the queue.  (It
	 *         may have been in the queue at some previous
	 *         time -- i.e., buzzer can be re-used).
	 *	  This makes sense:  you can't give the same
	 *	  buzzer to two people!
	 *
	 *       (2) Reusable Buzzers:  A re-usable buzzer is 
	 *	  a buzzer that _was_ in the queue at some previous
	 *	  time, but currently is not.
	 *
         *         REQUIREMENT:  If there is one or more reusable
         *         buzzer, you MUST return one of them; furthermore,
         *         it must be the buzzer that became reusable most 
         *         MOST RECENTLY.
	 *
	 *       (3) if there are no previously-used / reusable buzzers, 
         *         the SMALLEST possible buzzer-ID is used (retrieved from 
         *         inventory).  
	 *	    Properties in this situation (where N is the current
	 *	      queue length):
	 *
	 *		- The largest buzzer-ID used so far is N-1
	 *
	 *		- All buzzer-IDs in {0..N-1} are in the queue
	 *			(in some order).
	 *
	 *		- The next buzzer-ID (from the basement) is N.
	 *
	 *    In other words, you can always get more buzzers (from
	 *    the basement or something), but you don't fetch an
	 *    additional buzzer unless you have to (i.e., no reusable buzzers).
	 *
	 * Comments/Reminders:
	 *
	 *	Rule (3) implies that when we start from an empty queue,
	 *	the first buzzer-ID will be 0 (zero).
	 *
	 *	Rule (2) does NOT require that the _minimum_ reuseable 
	 *	buzzer-ID be used.  If there are multiple reuseable buzzers, 
	 *	any one of them will do.
	 *	
	 *	Note the following property:  if there are no re-useable 
	 *	buzzers, the queue contains all buzzers in {0..N-1} where
	 *       N is the current queue length (of course, the buzzer IDs 
	 *	may be in any order.)
	 *
	 * RUNTIME REQUIREMENT:  O(1)  ON AVERAGE or "AMORTIZED"  
	 *          In other words, if there have been M calls to 
	 *		give_buzzer, the total time taken for those 
	 *		M calls is O(M).
	 *
	 *		An individual call may therefore not be O(1) so long
	 *		as when taken as a whole they average constant time.
